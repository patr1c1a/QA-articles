# QA articles

These are articles I wrote about Quality Assurance and related topics, based on my experience in the field. Some of them are published in [my LinkedIn profile](www.linkedin.com/in/patriciamiguel/detail/recent-activity/posts/).

This repository will only contain PDF files with the articles. Some of them refer to example projects that are stored in other repositories under my GitHub profile. In those cases, the article will point to the specific repository that needs to be downloaded.
